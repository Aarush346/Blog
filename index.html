     <h4>John Kerry warns a long Ukraine war would threaten climate efforts</h4>

        The longer the war in Ukraine carries on, the worse the consequences will be for the climate, the US presidential envoy John Kerry has warned.

Many countries are struggling with an energy crisis while also urgently needing to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global heating to 1.5C, he said.

“If it’s a long period of time, obviously that makes [staying within 1.5C] very complicated,” Kerry said. “It depends on what happens with the war, where the war goes and how long it lasts. If miraculously we can somehow find a way to resolve some of the fundamental problems in the next six months, then maybe we could just accelerate everything together. I think we can make up some distance [in progress on tackling the climate crisis].”

     <h4>A first: Scientists grow plants in soil from the Moon</h4>

        Scientists have grown plants in soil from the Moon, a first in human history and a milestone in lunar and space exploration.

In a new paper published in the journal Communications Biology, University of Florida researchers showed that plants can successfully sprout and grow in lunar soil. Their study also investigated how plants respond biologically to the Moon's soil, also known as lunar regolith, which is radically different from soil found on Earth.

This work is a first step toward one day growing plants for food and oxygen on the Moon or during space missions. More immediately, this research comes as the Artemis Program plans to return humans to the Moon.

     <h4>Deserts 'breathe' water vapor, study shows</h4>
        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.d0ZW8jFGKwexKzOGcpOmeQHaE8?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">

        Deserts may seem lifeless and inert, but they are very much alive. Sand dunes, in particular, grow and move -- and according to a decades long research project, they also breathe humid air.

The findings show for the first time how water vapor penetrates powders and grains, and could have wide-ranging applications far beyond the desert -- in pharmaceutical research, agriculture and food processing, as well as planetary exploration.

The team's paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Earth Surface.

Wanting to measure matter with greater sensitivity, lead author Michel Louge, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Cornell University, developed a new form of instrumentation called capacitance probes, which use multiple sensors to record everything from solid concentration to velocity to water content, all with unprecedented spatial resolution.
